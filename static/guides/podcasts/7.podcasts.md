# Introduction
ABS is designed to serve local media files from a library. A podcast library can automatically download new episodes from an RSS feed to the server for archival and listening purposes. ABS is currently *not* designed to be a browser for searching online for individual podcast episodes. If you do not want your ABS server downloading podcast episodes, the current stance is to use a (different) normal podcast app.

This guide assumes you have already set up a [podcast library](https://www.audiobookshelf.org/guides/podcasts)

# Add a podcast from an RSS feed
You can search for podcasts to add to your library in both the web browser and in the ABS app.
