<ul>
<li>This installation method is still in testing.</li>
<li>Only in the nixos-unstable channel for now</li>
</ul>
</div>

## Installation

Imperative installation:
```bash
nix-env -iA audiobookshelf
```

Declarative installation:
```nix
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  audiobookshelf
];
```


## Configuration

You can configure Audiobookshelf using the parameters to the executable.
It supports the same configuration options you would pass to the Docker container,
the options below are the defaults if the option is missing.

```bash
audiobookshelf --metadata "$(pwd)/metadata" \
  --config "$(pwd)/config" \
  --port 8000 \
  --host 0.0.0.0
```

If you use a reverse proxy (you should!) listing on localhost only would be enough.
In this case set `--host 127.0.0.1` instead.

## Start Audiobookshelf

You can create a simple systemd service in your `configuration.nix` to automatically start
audiobookshelf after a reboot.

```nix
{
  users = {
    groups.audiobookshelf.members = [ "audiobookshelf" ];
    users.audiobookshelf.isSystemUser = true;
  };

  systemd.services.audiobookshelf = with pkgs; {
    enable = true;
    description = "Self-hosted audiobook server for managing and playing audiobooks";
    serviceConfig = {
      Type = "simple";
      WorkingDirectory = "/usr/share/audiobookshelf";
      ExecStart = "${audiobookshelf}/bin/audiobookshelf --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000"
      ExecReload = "${util-linux}/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID";
      Restart = "always";
      User = "audiobookshelf";
      Group = "audiobookshelf";
    };
    wantedBy = [ "multi-user.target" ];
    requires = [ "network.target" ];
  };
}
```

You can create a simple SystemD service to automatically start audiobookshelf after a reboot.
Write a file `audiobookshelf.service` to `/etc/systemd/system/` with the following contents:

To run Audiobookshelf and ensure it will be started automatically after a reboot, run:

```bash
systemctl start audiobookshelf.service
systemctl enable audiobookshelf.service
```

To check the current status of the service, run:

```bash
systemctl status audiobookshelf.service
```
