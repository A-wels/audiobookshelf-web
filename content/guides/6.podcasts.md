# Introduction
ABS is designed to serve local media files from a library. A podcast library can automatically download new episodes from an RSS feed to the server for archival and listening purposes. ABS is currently *not* designed to be a browser for searching for podcasts. If you do not want your ABS server downloading podcast episodes, use a normal podcast app.
