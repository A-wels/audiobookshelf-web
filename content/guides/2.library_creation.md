# Introduction
This guide will help you to create a library in ABS. This guide assumes you have correctly configured your installation.

Screenshots are from an install of v2.2.0 in Docker, but remain mostly unchanged in v2.2.20.

# Setting up a library

ABS supports two kinds of libraries: book and podcast. Both kinds of library allow individual items to be added to the library. A podcast library can also download new episodes from an RSS feed automatically.
To create a library file in ABS:
* Create a library directory for either [audiobooks](https://www.audiobookshelf.org/docs#book-structure) or [podcasts](https://www.audiobookshelf.org/docs#podcast-structure)
* Go to (1) Settings -> (2) Library -> (3) Add Library. This installation already has two libraries set up (named "Audible" and "Podcasts")

* Set library paths. You can either type the path manually or Browse for Folder. If you have multiple directories where books/podcasts are stored, you can add multiple paths to the library. NOTE: There are issues with the "Browse for Folder" button on some systems, so you may need to enter the path manually if the button is not working.

* Modify library settings (you can edit these later)

* You can also set a schedule to rescan the library for new books or changes. This periodic scan is disabled by default.

* Once you have created the library, you should see something like this.

* You can create more libraries to either divide books or add podcasts. If you have multiple libraries, you can switch between them using the button in red. I went ahead and created a podcast library to demonstrate this.

* Now that the library is created, you can scan the library to have books added to the library. You can either do this from the home screen or the settings page. NOTE: this view has changed slightly, with the buttons being located in the dropdown menu of 3 vertical dots.

# Conclusion
You should now have a functioning library!

# Notes and Troubleshooting
* If you get an error about "permission denied", the permissions of a folder are probably incorrect. This could be an issue with the library directory or the cache or metadata directory (most likely the library directory if you made it this far). Ensure the audiobookshelf user has read and write permission to the directory.
* Not everything fits perfectly into a book or podcast type (such as radio dramas). Discussion has occurred about how to incorporate them better, but has not been finalized.
