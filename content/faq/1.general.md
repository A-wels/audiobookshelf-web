This page aims to answer common general questions.

## Where can I get help?

1. Join the community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HQgCbd6E75) or [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#audiobookshelf:matrix.org).
2. Go to the [Github repo](https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf) and at the top left of the page you can search for your issue.

## I have a feature request. How should I bring this up?

First, check the GitHub issues. There are two repositories, one for the [server and web client](https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf), and one for [the apps](https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf-app).
You may need to try a few different search terms because someone else may have used different words to explain what they wanted.

If your feature request already exists, you can react with the "thumbs up" reaction to the top comment.
Please don't bump posts by just saying "+1" or "I also want this" unless you have something to add to the feature request.
You can also express support for an existing feature request in Discord/Matrix.

If your feature request does not exist, you can create a new Feature Request or talk about it on Discord/Matrix.
