# App FAQ
This section aims to answer common questions related to the app.

## Something stopped working after an app update

Sometimes things behave weirdly after the app or server updates.

First, try clearing the app's cache, or uninstalling and reinstalling the app.
This will require you to sign in to all servers again.

If your issue persists, feel free to ask in Discord/Matrix or look for an existing GH issue.

## When will the apps be out of beta?

The apps will be out of beta when they are deemed to be stable enough and all of the desired features are added.
There are still a number of features missing and other quirks that we want to figure out before leaving beta.

Android has more features than iOS, but all of these features are planned for iOS (with no estimate on when any given feature is implemented).

UPDATE: Due to the ever increasing requests to join the TestFlight, the iOS app will likely be released soon to at least allow people to use the app.
This full release will not have feature parity with the Android app, should not have show-stopping bugs, and will likely lag behind the releases within TestFlight.

A checklist tracking the main remaining bugs is located [here](https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf-app/issues/541).
*Please do not* leave additional comments on this issue requesting the app to be released, this has already been communicated in various GitHub and Discord discussions.

## How do I get an invite to Testflight/The iOS beta is full?

To join the iOS beta, you first need to have the TestFlight app installed on your device.
From that same device, click on the "Download on the App Store" link on this site.
The invite code is embedded in the link.

Apple has a hard limit on how many people can be a part of the beta.
Users who are not keeping the iOS app up to date are periodically removed from the beta to make room for others.

Sometimes, there's a problem on Apple's end that prevents removing old accounts, so it may be some time before more spots are available.

## Why can't I do X in the app?

Features are still being added and bugs are still being worked out.

The apps are designed to allow you to use the server, not manage the server.
Some management functionality may eventually be added, but if you want to manage the server from your phone you will need to use the web browser.
Note that some buttons may not show up in the mobile view and you will need to either switch to landscape or the Desktop view if a button is missing.
